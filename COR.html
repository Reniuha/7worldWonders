            <p>Name: Colossus of Rhodes
                Location: Rhodes, Greece (at the entrance of the harbor)
                Period: Completed around 292–280 BCE.
                Artist: The statue was created by the Greek sculptor Chares of Lindos, a student of the famous sculptor Lysippus.
                Height: The Colossus was approximately 33 meters (108 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest statues of the ancient world.
                Material: Made primarily of bronze and iron, with a stone base.
                Purpose: The statue was built to celebrate Rhodes’ victory over Cyprus in 305 BCE, symbolizing the island's strength and resilience.</p>

            <p class="header">Description:</p>
            <p>Design: The statue depicted the sun god Helios, who was the patron deity of the island of Rhodes. It was shown standing with one foot forward, possibly straddling the entrance to the harbor or standing with his legs apart on either side of the harbor (though some versions suggest different placements, like standing at the harbor's entrance).
                Appearance: The Colossus was a full-length figure of a man, with the body of Helios being highly detailed. The statue held a torch in one hand and a shield or spear in the other. The positioning of the statue and its size made it a spectacular sight for sailors approaching the island.</p>

            <p class="header">Construction and Design:</p>
            <p>Engineering Feat: Constructed after the island of Rhodes successfully withstood a siege by Demetrius I of Macedon in 305 BCE, the statue was a symbol of triumph. Its construction was a massive engineering challenge, as it required a great deal of bronze to create such a large and intricate statue.
                Bronze and Iron: The statue was made primarily of bronze plates, which were stretched over an iron frame. It was supported by an internal structure of iron and stone. The scale of the work and the materials used to create the Colossus were unprecedented at the time.
                Foundation: The Colossus stood on a large marble pedestal at the entrance to the harbor, which itself was impressive in scale. The base of the statue was approximately 15 meters (49 feet) tall.</p>

            <p class="header">Cultural and Symbolic Significance:</p>
            <p>Symbol of Victory: The Colossus was built to commemorate Rhodes' victory over Cyprus, where they had successfully fended off the siege by Demetrius I. It was a symbol of both military triumph and the power of the island.
                Helios as Patron: The choice to depict Helios was a nod to the patron god of Rhodes, who was often associated with the sun and light. It also reflected the religious and cultural significance of the island in the ancient Mediterranean world.</p>
