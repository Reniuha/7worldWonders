            <p class="header">Basic Facts:</p>
            <p>Name: Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos of Alexandria)
                Location: The lighthouse was located on the small island of Pharos, which was connected to the city of Alexandria by a causeway. Alexandria was a major port city in Egypt, situated on the Mediterranean Sea.
                Period: Constructed between 280 and 247 BCE, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus.
                Architect: The lighthouse was designed by the Greek architect Sostratus of Cnidus, although some sources suggest that the project was overseen by Ptolemy II himself.
                Height: Estimates of its height vary, but the lighthouse was likely around 100 to 130 meters (330 to 430 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest man-made structures in the world at the time.</p>

            <p class="header">Description:</p>
            <p>Design: The Lighthouse of Alexandria was a massive, multi-tiered tower that rose out of the sea, visible from miles away. It was designed to guide ships safely into the harbor of Alexandria, one of the most important ports in the ancient world.
                Base: The base of the lighthouse was a square platform, on which the main tower stood.
                Tower: The tower was circular in shape, with a series of terraces that narrowed as the tower rose higher.
                Statue of Zeus: On top of the lighthouse was a large statue of Zeus or Poseidon (accounts vary), often thought to represent the god of the sea, as a symbol of protection for sailors. The statue was said to be holding a torch, further symbolizing the guiding light of the lighthouse.
                Function: The main purpose of the lighthouse was to help sailors navigate safely into the harbor of Alexandria at night and during stormy weather. It housed a large flame that acted as a beacon for ships, guiding them away from the dangerous rocks and shallow waters around the harbor.</p>

            <p class="header">Construction and Design:</p>
            <p>Materials: The lighthouse was constructed primarily of limestone and marble, providing both durability and aesthetic beauty. The use of marble also made the lighthouse visually striking.
                Fire and Reflectors: The lighthouse featured an enormous fire at its summit, which burned continuously to create a bright light visible for miles. Some accounts suggest that large reflectors were used to amplify the light and increase its range, though the exact method remains debated.</p>

            <p class="header">Technological Innovations:</p>
            <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria was considered one of the most advanced structures of its time due to its use of light for navigation. In addition to the large flame at the top, it was said to be one of the first lighthouses to employ reflective materials to direct the light more effectively.
                Mirrors and Reflectors: Some descriptions suggest that polished mirrors or reflective surfaces were used to concentrate and focus the light from the flame, increasing its visibility. These innovations were centuries ahead of their time.</p>
