            <p class="header">Basic Facts:</p>
            <p>Name: The Colosseum (officially the Flavian Amphitheatre).

                Construction Date: Construction began in 70 CE under the Roman Emperor Vespasian and was completed in 80 CE under his son Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96 CE).
                Dimensions: The Colosseum measures about 189 meters (615 feet) in length, 156 meters (510 feet) in width, and stands approximately 48 meters (157 feet) tall.
                Capacity: It could hold between 50,000 to 70,000 spectators at its peak, depending on the arrangement of seating.</p>

            <p class="header">Construction and Architecture:</p>
            <p>The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of engineering. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.
                It was constructed with an estimated 2.3 million limestone blocks, each weighing between 2.5 to 15 tons.
                The pyramid was originally covered with smooth, white Tura limestone casing stones, which reflected the sun’s light, making it shine brightly. Most of these casing stones have since been removed or weathered away.
                Inside the pyramid, there are several chambers, including the King’s Chamber, Queen’s Chamber, and the Grand Gallery.</p>

            <p class="header">History:</p>
            <p>The Flavian Dynasty: The Colosseum was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty (hence its alternative name, the Flavian Amphitheatre) as a symbol of the emperor’s power and generosity. It was built on the site of the Nero's Golden House (Domus Aurea), a lavish palace complex built by Emperor Nero, symbolizing the new rulers’ desire to distance themselves from Nero’s unpopular reign.
                Inauguration: The Colosseum was officially opened by Emperor Titus in 80 CE with 100 days of games, including gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and mock naval battles. These games were an essential part of Roman culture and were often used by emperors to gain favor with the public.
                Gladiatorial Games and Public Spectacles: The primary purpose of the Colosseum was to host gladiatorial games—fights between gladiators, slaves, or criminals, often to the death. The arena also hosted animal hunts (venationes), mock naval battles (naumachiae), and public executions, which were designed to entertain the masses and demonstrate the might of the Roman Empire.
                Decline: After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Colosseum’s use declined. It was damaged by several earthquakes, and much of its stone and marble was stripped for use in other construction projects. By the Middle Ages, the Colosseum had become a site for Christian rituals and was even used as a fortress.</p>
