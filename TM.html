            <p class="header">History:</p>
            <p>Commissioning by Shah Jahan: The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan, the Mughal Emperor, in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. Mumtaz Mahal died in 1631 during the birth of their 14th child, and Shah Jahan, devastated by her loss, vowed to build a monument that would symbolize their eternal love.
                Mumtaz Mahal: Mumtaz Mahal was Shah Jahan's favorite wife, and she was known for her beauty, intelligence, and kindness. Her death deeply affected the emperor, and the Taj Mahal was intended as both her tomb and a tribute to her.
                Construction: The construction of the Taj Mahal involved a large team of architects, designers, and artisans from across the empire and beyond. The chief architect was Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, and it is believed that over 20,000 workers were involved in the construction process.
                Completion: The Taj Mahal was completed in 1653, but the complex continued to be enhanced with additional structures and gardens over time.</p>

            <p class="header">The Taj Mahal Complex</p>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is part of a larger complex that includes several key elements:

                Main Gateway: The monumental gateway at the entrance to the Taj Mahal complex is made of red sandstone and features beautiful Islamic calligraphy and motifs.
                Mosque and Guest House: On the grounds of the Taj Mahal, there is a mosque and a guest house (called the Jawab). The mosque, built from red sandstone, faces the Taj Mahal and is used for prayers. The Jawab is believed to have been built as a symmetrical structure to balance the mosque and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the complex.
                The Garden: The charbagh garden is a key element of the Taj Mahal's design. It is divided into four quadrants by water channels and walkways, symbolizing the four rivers of paradise. The garden was designed to be a peaceful, reflective space.
