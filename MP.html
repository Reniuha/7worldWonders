            <p class="header">Basic Facts:</p>
            <p>Name: Machu Picchu (which means “Old Peak” in Quechua)
                Location: Cusco Region, Peru, in the Andes Mountains at an altitude of about 2,430 meters (7,970 feet) above sea level.
                Construction Date: The city was built in the 15th century, likely around 1450 during the height of the Inca Empire.
                Purpose: Machu Picchu is believed to have served as a royal estate or religious retreat for the Incan emperor Pachacuti, though its exact function remains a subject of debate among archaeologists.
                Discovery by the Western World: While locals were aware of Machu Picchu for centuries, it was Hiram Bingham, an American explorer, who rediscovered it for the outside world in 1911.</p>

            <p class="header">History:</p>
            <p>Inca Empire: Machu Picchu was built by the Incas, a highly advanced civilization that controlled much of western South America from the early 15th century until the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The Incas were known for their remarkable engineering skills, and Machu Picchu is a testament to their ingenuity.
                Abandonment: The site was abandoned by the Incas in the mid-16th century, likely due to the Spanish conquest and the collapse of the Inca Empire. It was never found by the Spanish, which allowed it to remain hidden and preserved for centuries.
                Rediscovery: In 1911, Hiram Bingham led an expedition to the site, bringing international attention to Machu Picchu. His discovery helped make the site one of the most famous archaeological wonders in the world.</p>

            <p class="header">Cultural and Historical Importance:</p>
            <p>Religious Significance: Machu Picchu was likely a place of worship, with many structures aligned with the movements of the sun and other celestial bodies. The Intihuatana stone (mentioned earlier) is thought to have been a solar observatory or a religious site connected to the Sun God, Inti.
                Symbol of the Inca Empire: The site represents the ingenuity, power, and spiritual depth of the Inca civilization. Its isolation from the rest of the empire helped preserve many aspects of Incan culture and architecture.
                Connection to Nature: The location of Machu Picchu atop a mountain suggests the Inca belief in the sacredness of nature. The mountains surrounding the site are thought to have been viewed as gods by the Incas.</p>

            <p class="header">Access:</p>
            <p>The Inca Trail: The most popular way to reach Machu Picchu is by hiking the Inca Trail, a four-day trek that starts in Km 82, near the town of Ollantaytambo. The trail takes hikers through stunning landscapes, including mountains, cloud forests, and Incan ruins.
                Alternative Treks: For those who prefer a less crowded route, there are other trekking options, such as the Salkantay Trail, Lares Trek, and Inca Jungle Trek.
                Train Access: Visitors can also take a scenic train ride from Cusco or Ollantaytambo to the town of Aguas Calientes, which is located at the base of Machu Picchu. From there, buses take visitors up the mountain to the entrance.</p>
