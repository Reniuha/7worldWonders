            <p class="header">Basic Facts:</p>
            <p>Name: Hanging Gardens of Babylon
                Location: Ancient Babylon (near modern-day Hillah, Iraq), though the exact location is uncertain.
                Era: Thought to have been constructed around 600 BCE during the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar II (605â€“562 BCE).
                Purpose: It was supposedly built to please Amytis of Media, Nebuchadnezzar's wife, who longed for the green hills and valleys of her homeland, which were far from the arid environment of Babylon.</p>

            <p class="header">Description:</p>
            <p>The gardens were described as a vast and tiered structure, with lush plants and trees growing on multiple levels, suspended or "hanging" from terraces.
                The gardens were reportedly built on an artificial mountain-like structure made of mud bricks, featuring a series of terraces or platforms that were irrigated to allow plants to flourish.
                Some ancient sources described it as a massive, lush, and multicolored oasis in the heart of the desert city, with a complex system of irrigation to water the gardens.</p>

            <p class="header">Construction and Design:</p>
            <p>According to ancient descriptions, the gardens were an extraordinary feat of engineering, with multiple levels built one atop the other. They may have resembled a terraced mountain with large, cascading plants.
                The use of a sophisticated irrigation system, possibly involving an Archimedes screw or other devices to pump water from the Euphrates River, was crucial in maintaining the gardens.
                The gardens are often depicted as a lush and exotic paradise, despite Babylon's location in a semi-arid region.</p>
