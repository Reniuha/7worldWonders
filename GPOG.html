            <p class="header">Construction and Architecture:</p>
            <p>The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of engineering. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years.
                It was constructed with an estimated 2.3 million limestone blocks, each weighing between 2.5 to 15 tons.
                The pyramid was originally covered with smooth, white Tura limestone casing stones, which reflected the sun’s light, making it shine brightly. Most of these casing stones have since been removed or weathered away.
                Inside the pyramid, there are several chambers, including the King’s Chamber, Queen’s Chamber, and the Grand Gallery.</p>

            <p class="header">Purpose and Significance:</p>
            <p>The pyramid was built as a tomb to house the body of Pharaoh Khufu, along with his possessions and treasures for the afterlife. However, much of the treasure has been looted over the millennia.
                The pyramid’s design symbolizes the sun’s rays, with the sides of the pyramid thought to represent the sun's beams.
                It’s part of a larger complex that includes temples, smaller pyramids for queens, and the famous Sphinx.</p>
