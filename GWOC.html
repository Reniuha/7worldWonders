            <p>Name: Great Wall of China
                Location: Northern China, stretching across multiple provinces from the Bohai Sea in the east to the Gobi Desert in the west.
                Length: The total length of all the sections of the Great Wall combined is about 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles). This makes it the longest wall or structure ever built.
                Time Period: The construction of the wall began in the 7th century BCE, during the Warring States period, but most of the existing sections were built during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE).
                Purpose: The primary purpose was to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire from invasions by nomadic tribes, including the Xiongnu, Mongols, and other groups. It also served as a physical barrier for controlling migration and trade.</p>

            <p class="header">Construction and History:</p>
            <p>Early Walls: The origins of the Great Wall trace back to the Warring States period (475-221 BCE) when various Chinese states built defensive walls to protect their territories. These early walls were relatively small and rudimentary.
                First Emperor of China: The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (221–210 BCE), is often credited with connecting and expanding these walls to form a more unified defense system, though the structure built during his reign was much less grand than the later Ming sections. The walls were made of tamped earth, stone, and wood.
                Ming Dynasty Walls: The most famous and well-preserved sections of the Great Wall were constructed during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE). The Ming Wall was built using more durable materials like brick and stone, and it was designed to be much taller and more formidable than earlier walls. Watchtowers and fortifications were added for surveillance and defense.
                Labor Force: The construction of the Great Wall involved an immense labor force, including soldiers, peasants, prisoners, and slaves. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of workers were involved over the centuries.</p>

            <p class="header">Structure and Features:</p>
            <p>Construction Materials: The materials used in the Great Wall varied depending on the location and time period:
                Tamped Earth: Early walls in the northern deserts were made using tamped earth or mud.
                Brick and Stone: Later sections, especially those from the Ming era, were built with bricks, stones, and mortar, making the wall more durable.
                Watchtowers and Fortifications: The wall was not a simple continuous structure; it was fortified with watchtowers, bastions, and gates at strategic points. The towers allowed for surveillance, communication, and defense.
                Design: The wall itself is not just a straight line—it zigzags across the terrain, following natural features such as mountains and valleys. This strategic placement allowed defenders to use the natural landscape to their advantage.
                Height and Width: The height of the wall varies, but on average, it is about 6–7 meters (20–23 feet) tall. In some places, it can reach up to 10 meters (33 feet). The width of the wall also varies, with some sections wide enough to allow carts to travel along it.</p>

                UNESCO World Heritage Site: In 1987, the Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, recognizing its cultural, historical, and architectural significance.
