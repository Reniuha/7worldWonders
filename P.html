            <p>Name: Petra
                Location: Ma'an Governorate, Jordan, in the southern part of the country, near the desert.
                Period: Founded in the 4th century BCE by the Nabataeans but flourished as a major city from the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century CE.
                Architectural Style: Petra is renowned for its rock-cut architecture, where buildings and tombs are carved directly into sandstone cliffs. The city was also notable for its advanced hydraulic engineering, which allowed it to thrive in an arid desert environment.
                Status: Petra was largely abandoned by the 7th century CE, though it remained known to locals and was rediscovered by the Western world in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.</p>

            <p class="header">History:</p>
            <p>Early Settlement: The area of Petra was inhabited as early as the 6th century BCE, but it was the Nabataeans who made it their capital and transformed it into a prosperous city. The Nabataeans were an Arab nomadic tribe that settled in the region, and they were known for their skills in trade, water conservation, and architecture.
                Nabataean Kingdom: Petra became the center of the Nabataean Kingdom, which controlled vital trade routes across the Arabian Peninsula. The city thrived as a commercial hub, facilitating trade in frankincense, myrrh, spices, and other valuable goods.
                Roman Influence: Petra eventually came under Roman control in 106 CE, but it retained much of its culture and traditions. During the Roman period, Petra’s importance as a trading center began to decline, especially as the Romans opened new trade routes.
                Decline: The decline of Petra accelerated after a series of earthquakes in the 4th and 5th centuries, which caused significant damage to the city's infrastructure. By the 7th century, the city had largely been abandoned, though it remained inhabited in some form for centuries.</p>

            <p class="header">Fun Fact</p>
            <p>Incredible Rock Color: Petra is often referred to as the “Rose City” due to the color of its sandstone, which appears in varying shades of red, pink, and orange, especially at sunrise and sunset.
                Cave Dwellings: In addition to the grand temples and tombs, Petra was also home to many smaller dwellings carved directly into the rock. These caves were used as homes, storage, and workshops by the city’s inhabitants.
                Modern Relevance: Petra is not just an archaeological site; it is also a living cultural heritage for the people of Jordan. The Bedouin people, who originally lived in the area, still inhabit the outskirts of Petra and maintain many traditions that date back centuries.</p>

            <p class="header">Cultural Impact:</p>
            <p>Trade Hub: Petra’s location at the crossroads of trade routes between Arabia, Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia made it a crucial trading hub. The Nabataeans controlled trade in spices, incense, textiles, and precious metals, and Petra flourished as a prosperous, multicultural city.
                Religious and Cultural Diversity: Petra was home to a variety of cultures and religions. While the Nabataeans practiced their own religion, many other cultures passed through or settled in Petra, leaving their mark. The city features numerous temples, altars, and monuments dedicated to different gods, including the Nabataean god Dushara and gods from the Greek and Roman pantheons.
                Iconic Status: Petra’s cultural and architectural achievements have made it a symbol of ancient ingenuity. The city’s dramatic setting, surrounded by towering sandstone cliffs and canyons, adds to its mystique and beauty.</p>
